Hey buckeroo, I see you were trynna get that good pikmn fix by making a skin weren't you?

Check it, this Olimar dude is a tad special.
	If you set the skin name to one of the next ones, you'll get a special color for your leader!

		Louie:Blue (I know he's yellow in 3 shut up)
		The President:Purple (This  one is mostly just personal preference im not even gonna lie)
		Adult Bulbmin: Green (I just thought it'd be cute)
		
		Alph: Aqua (Also known as light blue)
		Brittany: Pink
		Charlie: Green
		
		[The default here is red, so there's no special case for the pikmin 4 rescue team, whose color is canonically red]
		Oatchi: Orange
		Moss: Green
	
	
	Here's some small little suggestions
	
		If you're using Pikmin 4 characters you can try changing the bulbmin to a glow pikmin
		
		Have the bridge/ladder parts change depending on the pikmin game the character originates from!
			Sticks for Pikmin 1 and 2
			Ceramic bridge fragments for Pikin 3
			And the checkered almost chocoalte looking bridges for Pikmin 4
			
	You of course don't have to do any of these things, the first thing you have to do, is have fun!
